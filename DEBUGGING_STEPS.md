# üîç Debugging Guide - Physical Fields Not Saving

## üéØ Current Situation

You mentioned you **entered the data** in the Height, Weight, Eye Color, and Hair Color fields, but they're not being saved or loaded back.

## üìù Step-by-Step Testing Process

### Step 1: Clear Console and Refresh

1. Open the Background Check form
2. **Clear your browser console** (right-click ‚Üí Clear console)
3. **Refresh the page**

### Step 2: Fill in ONE Field and Watch Console

1. Click in the **Height** field
2. Type: `5'10"`
3. **Immediately check the console** for this log:
   ```
   ‚≠ê PHYSICAL FIELD CHANGED: height = "5'10""
   üîµ Form state after change for height: { height: "5'10"", ... }
   ```

**If you DON'T see this log** ‚Üí The onChange handler isn't working. Check if the input field is read-only or disabled.

**If you DO see this log** ‚Üí Continue to Step 3.

### Step 3: Fill in ALL Physical Fields

Fill in:

- Height: `5'10"`
- Weight: `175`
- Eye Color: `Blue`
- Hair Color: `Brown`

After each field, verify you see the `‚≠ê PHYSICAL FIELD CHANGED` log.

### Step 4: Fill in Required Fields

The form requires:

- ‚úÖ Last Name (should already be filled from Employment App)
- ‚úÖ First Name (should already be filled from Employment App)
- ‚úÖ Social Security Number (should already be filled from Employment App)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Signature** (you MUST sign this!)

**Draw a signature** in the signature pad.

### Step 5: Submit the Form

1. Click **"Save & Next"** button
2. Watch the console for:
   ```
   ========== FORM SUBMISSION STARTED ==========
   ‚≠ê PHYSICAL FIELDS AT SUBMIT: {
     height: "5'10\"",
     weight: '175',
     eyeColor: 'Blue',
     hairColor: 'Brown'
   }
   ```

**If these show empty strings** ‚Üí The form state wasn't updated. Go back to Step 2.

**If these show your values** ‚Üí Continue to Step 6.

### Step 6: Check Backend Response

After clicking Save, look for:

```
üî¥ Payload structure:
actualBackgroundFieldValues: {
  height: "5'10\"",
  weight: '175',
  eyeColor: 'Blue',
  hairColor: 'Brown'
}
```

Then look for:

```
üü¢ Save response received: { data: { ... } }
```

**If you see an error** ‚Üí Share the error message with me.

**If you see success** ‚Üí Continue to Step 7.

### Step 7: Refresh and Verify

1. **Refresh the page**
2. Check console for:
   ```
   üü£ Final merged - Physical fields: {
     height: "5'10\"",
     weight: '175',
     eyeColor: 'Blue',
     hairColor: 'Brown'
   }
   ```
3. **Check the form fields** - they should show your values!

## üö® Common Issues

### Issue 1: onChange Not Firing

**Symptom**: No `‚≠ê PHYSICAL FIELD CHANGED` log when typing

**Causes**:

- Field is `readOnly={true}` when it shouldn't be
- Field is `disabled`
- HR View mode is active (check URL for `?hr=true`)

**Solution**: Check the input field props in the code

### Issue 2: Form State Not Updating

**Symptom**: `‚≠ê PHYSICAL FIELD CHANGED` logs show correct value, but `‚≠ê PHYSICAL FIELDS AT SUBMIT` shows empty

**Cause**: React state update timing issue

**Solution**: Try typing slower, or adding a small delay before submitting

### Issue 3: Validation Fails

**Symptom**: Error toast saying "Please fill in all required fields"

**Cause**: Missing signature or other required fields

**Solution**:

- Draw a signature in the signature pad
- Check all required fields are filled

### Issue 4: Backend Error

**Symptom**: 400, 404, or 500 error in console

**Causes**:

- Application ID not found
- Employee ID not found
- Invalid payload

**Solution**: Share the exact error message and I'll help debug

### Issue 5: Data Doesn't Persist

**Symptom**: Form saves successfully but data disappears on refresh

**Cause**: Backend isn't actually saving to database (check backend logs)

**Solution**:

1. Check backend console for `üü¢ VERIFICATION - Physical fields in DB:`
2. If fields show as empty there, the issue is in the backend save logic

## üìä Backend Logs to Check

In your backend terminal, after clicking Save, look for:

```
üü° ApplicantInfo field values:
   - height: 5'10"
   - weight: 175
   - eyeColor: Blue
   - hairColor: Brown

üü¢ VERIFICATION - Physical fields in DB: {
  height: "5'10\"",
  weight: '175',
  eyeColor: 'Blue',
  hairColor: 'Brown'
}
```

**If backend shows empty values** ‚Üí Frontend isn't sending data correctly

**If backend shows correct values** ‚Üí Data is being saved, check the GET endpoint

## üîß Quick Test Commands

### Test Backend Directly (using curl or Postman):

```bash
# Test Save
curl -X POST http://localhost:1111/onboarding/save-background-check \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "applicationId": "68cd668621dec4327dd0d41f",
    "employeeId": "68cd667621dec4327dd0d419",
    "formData": {
      "applicantInfo": {
        "height": "5'\''10\"",
        "weight": "175",
        "eyeColor": "Blue",
        "hairColor": "Brown",
        "firstName": "Test",
        "lastName": "User",
        "socialSecurityNumber": "123-45-6789"
      }
    },
    "status": "draft"
  }'

# Test Get
curl http://localhost:1111/onboarding/get-background-check/68cd668621dec4327dd0d41f
```

## üì∏ What to Share with Me

If it's still not working, please share:

1. **Console logs** showing:

   - The `‚≠ê PHYSICAL FIELD CHANGED` logs
   - The `‚≠ê PHYSICAL FIELDS AT SUBMIT` logs
   - The `üî¥ Payload structure` logs
   - Any error messages

2. **Backend logs** showing:

   - The `üü° ApplicantInfo field values` logs
   - The `üü¢ VERIFICATION - Physical fields in DB` logs
   - Any error messages

3. **URL** you're accessing (to check if you're in HR mode)

4. **Screenshot** of the filled form (before clicking Save)

---

## ‚úÖ Expected Success Flow

```
1. Type "5'10"" in Height field
   ‚Üí Console: ‚≠ê PHYSICAL FIELD CHANGED: height = "5'10""

2. Fill all other fields
   ‚Üí Console: Multiple ‚≠ê logs

3. Click "Save & Next"
   ‚Üí Console: ‚≠ê PHYSICAL FIELDS AT SUBMIT: { height: "5'10"", ... }
   ‚Üí Console: üî¥ actualBackgroundFieldValues: { height: "5'10"", ... }
   ‚Üí Backend: üü¢ VERIFICATION - Physical fields in DB: { height: "5'10"", ... }
   ‚Üí Toast: "Background check form submitted successfully!"

4. Refresh page
   ‚Üí Console: üü£ Final merged - Physical fields: { height: "5'10"", ... }
   ‚Üí Form: Fields are filled with your data ‚úÖ
```

This should work perfectly now with all the logging in place!
